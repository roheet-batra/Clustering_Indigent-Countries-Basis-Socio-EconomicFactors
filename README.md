HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities. It runs a lot of operational projects from time to time along with advocacy drives to raise awareness as well as for funding purposes.

After the recent funding programs, they have been able to raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. The significant issues that come while making this decision are mostly related to choosing the countries that are in direct need of aid. 

And this is where you come in as a data analyst. Your job is to categorize the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Then you need to suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most. The datasets contain those socio-economic factors that will help predict those countries. Some of the variables with their basic understanding are provided as follows: 

## <font color = Green > Variables Description </font>

1. **GDP:** Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) measures a country's economic output per person and is calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population. Per capita GDP is a global measure for gauging the prosperity of nations and is used by economists, along with GDP, to analyze the prosperity of a country based on its economic growth. Small, rich countries and more developed industrial countries tend to have the highest per capita GDP
2. **Child Mortality Rate:** The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1,000 live births.
3. **Income Level:** Per capita income is a measure of the amount of money earned per person in a nation. Per capita income for a nation is calculated by dividing the country's national income by its population.
4. **Inflation:** Inflation is the rate of increase in prices over a given period of time. Inflation is typically a broad measure, such as the overall increase in prices or the increase in the cost of living in a country.
5. **Life Expectancy:** The term “life expectancy” refers to the number of years a person can expect to live. ... By definition, life expectancy is based on an estimate of the average age that members of a particular population group will be when they die.
6. **Total Fertility Rate:** The TFR is usually simply described as the average number of children per woman. TFR is the sum of the age-specific birth rates (5-year age groups between 10 and 49) for female residents of a specified geographic area (nation, state, county, etc.) during a specified time period (usually a calendar year) multiplied by 5.

+ Your main task is to cluster the countries by the factors mentioned above, Analyse the clusters and identify the ones which are in direct need of aid and then present your solution and recommendations to the CEO. 
+ You can analyse the clusters by comparing how the variables vary for each cluster of countries to recognise and differentiate the clusters of developed countries from the clusters of under-developed countries.
+ Here, make sure that you report back at least 5 countries which are in direct need of aid from the analysis work that you perform.

2. EDA
3. Prepare the data for modelling
